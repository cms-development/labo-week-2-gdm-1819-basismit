It\'s different from a blog post because it will stay in one place and will show up in your site navigation (in most themes). Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site visitors. It might say something like this:\n\n<blockquote>Hi there! I\'m a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my website. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like pi&#241;a coladas. (And gettin\' caught in the rain.)</blockquote>\n\n...or something like this:\n\n<blockquote>The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickeys to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the Gotham community.</blockquote>\n\nAs a new WordPress user, you should go to <a href=\"http://labo1.local/wp-admin/\">your dashboard</a> to delete this page and create new pages for your content.

The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.\r\n<h3>Media</h3>\r\nIf you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.\r\n<h3>Contact forms</h3>\r\n<h3>Cookies</h3>\r\nIf you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.\r\n\r\nIf you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.\r\n\r\nWhen you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select \"Remember Me\", your login will persist for two weeks.

Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.\r\n\r\nThese websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.\r\n<h3>Analytics</h3>\r\n<h2>Who we share your data with</h2>\r\n<h2>How long we retain your data</h2>\r\nIf you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely.

All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username).

You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.\r\n<h2>Where we send your data</h2>\r\nVisitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.\r\n<h2>Your contact information</h2>\r\n<h2>Additional information</h2>\r\n<h3>How we protect your data</h3>\r\n<h3>What data breach procedures we have in place</h3>\r\n<h3>What third parties we receive data from</h3>\r\n<h3>What automated decision making and/or profiling we do with user data</h3>\r\n<h3>Industry regulatory disclosure requirements</h3>","Privacy Policy","","inherit","closed","closed","","3-revision-v1","","","2018-09-26 11:46:51","2018-09-26 09:46:51","",3,"http://labo1.local/2018/09/26/3-revision-v1/",0,"revision","",0),
